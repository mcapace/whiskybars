    ogRecipe: `2 parts Maker's Mark 46®
1 part sweet vermouth
2 dashes Angostura® bitters
Luxardo® cherry for garnish

Combine ingredients over ice in a mixing glass. Stir and strain into a chilled cocktail glass neat or on the rocks. Garnish with a Luxardo® cherry.`,
    freshTake: `Today's bartenders revisit the Manhattan through nuance, not novelty. They explore the spectrum of vermouths from blanc to dry, utilize bitters with chocolate or cherry, and introduce smoke or barrel-aging for added depth. Each variation reflects the dialogue between sweetness and spirit, reaffirming why this drink remains a benchmark.`,

    ogRecipe: `2 parts Suntory Toki®
4 parts chilled soda water
Lemon twist for garnish

Fill a highball glass with ice. Add whisky, then top with soda water. Stir gently once or twice. Express lemon twist over drink and drop in or discard.`,
    freshTake: `The Japanese Highball has elevated a simple serve into a ritual of precision. Bartenders obsess over ice clarity, carbonation levels, and the exact ratio of whisky to water. Some add citrus oils or swap soda for tonic or ginger ale. The result: a refreshingly deliberate drink.`,

1 part sweet vermouth
2 dashes Angostura® bitters
Brandied cherry for garnish

Stir ingredients with ice and strain into a chilled coupe. Garnish with a brandied cherry.`,
    freshTake: `The Rob Roy invites experimentation with Scotch's regional diversity. Bartenders might swap in peated Islay malts for smoke or sherried Speysides for richness. Vermouth choices—from dry to blanc—shift the balance, while bitters add complexity. A Scottish cousin of the Manhattan, it rewards those who explore.`,

    ogRecipe: `2 parts Knob Creek® Bourbon
1 sugar cube
2-3 dashes Angostura® bitters
Orange peel for garnish

Muddle sugar cube with bitters and a splash of water. Add bourbon and ice. Stir until chilled. Express orange peel over drink and drop in.`,
    freshTake: `The Old Fashioned is the cocktail canon's cornerstone, and bartenders treat it with reverence and creativity in equal measure. Variations include smoked presentations, maple or demerara syrups, and whiskey swaps from rye to Japanese. The best versions honor simplicity while revealing depth.`,

    ogRecipe: `1.5 parts Basil Hayden's® Bourbon
1 part Campari®
1 part sweet vermouth
Orange twist for garnish

Stir all ingredients with ice and strain into a chilled coupe or rocks glass over a large ice cube. Garnish with an orange twist.`,
    freshTake: `A whiskey-based Negroni variation, the Boulevardier rewards bourbon's vanilla sweetness against Campari's bitter edge. Modern takes experiment with rye for spice, aged vermouths for depth, or aperitivos beyond Campari. Some add amaro floats or citrus oils to brighten the profile.`,

0.75 parts fresh lemon juice
0.75 parts honey syrup (3:1 honey to water)

Shake all ingredients with ice and strain into a chilled rocks glass over fresh ice. No garnish needed.`,
    freshTake: `A modern classic born at NYC's Milk & Honey, the Gold Rush reimagines the whiskey sour with honey's floral sweetness. Bartenders experiment with infused honeys, ginger additions, or egg white for texture. Seasonal variations might feature apple or pear, but the template remains elegantly simple.`,
